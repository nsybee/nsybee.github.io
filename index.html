      <h3> Word frequency Counter</h3>
      <p> <b>Project Description:</b> 
        The Word Frequency Counter and Analysis Tool is a Python application that allows users to analyze text input, providing insights into word frequencies, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and misspelled words detection. 
        This tool is designed to help users understand the content and sentiment of textual data.</p> 
        This project was developed to showcase my skills and provide a useful tool for analyzing and understanding textual data.</p>
        <br><br><br>
       <p><b>Features</b><br><br>
        <b>Word Frequency Analysis:</b> The tool counts the frequency of each word in the input text and displays the top N most common words along with their frequencies. This feature helps users quickly identify key terms and themes in the text.<br>
        <b>Sentiment Analysis:</b> The tool performs sentiment analysis on the input text, providing a sentiment score that indicates whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis aids in understanding the emotional tone of the text.<br>
        <b>Named Entity Recognition:</b> The tool identifies named entities (proper nouns and named phrases) in the text, giving users insight into important entities mentioned.<br>
        <b>Misspelled Words Detection:</b> The tool uses the SpellChecker library to identify misspelled words in the text and suggests corrected versions. This feature ensures accurate analysis by addressing spelling errors.<br>
        <b>Word Cloud Visualization:</b> The tool generates a word cloud visualization to visually represent the frequency of words in the input text. Common words are displayed with larger font sizes, making it easy to identify prevalent terms.</p>
        <br><br>
        <P><b>Motivation</b><br><br>
        I decided to build this project to demonstrate my proficiency in software development and data analysis. Word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition are common tasks in natural language processing, and I wanted to create a tool that showcases my skills in these areas. Additionally, the project provides a practical utility for students, writers, and professionals who need to quickly analyze and understand the content of textual data.</P>
        <br>
        <p><b>Challenges and Solutions</b><br><br>
        One challenge was integrating the SpellChecker library for misspelled words detection. Overcoming this challenge required understanding the library's API and properly preprocessing text for accurate results. Additionally, designing an intuitive user interface for input and result display posed design challenges, which were resolved through iterative UI design and testing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Technologies and Libraries Used</b><br><br>
        Python<br>
        NLTK and TextBlob<br>
        SpellChecker<br>
        Matplotlib<br>
        WordCloud</p>
        <p><br>
        In summary, the Word Frequency Counter and Analysis Tool is a comprehensive project that showcases my expertise in software engineering, data analysis, and natural language processing. It serves as a valuable tool for users looking to gain insights from text data and exemplifies my commitment to developing practical solutions using cutting-edge technologies.
